/* Question - 1
Dino bought an array A having N integer values. After playing it for a while, he got bored of it and decided to update value of its element. In one second he can increase value of  each array element by 1. He wants each array element's value to become greater than or equal to K. Please help Dino to find out the minimum amount of time it will take, for him to do so.
Input: 
First line consists of two integers denoting N and K which are separated by a space. 
Second line consists of N space separated integers denoting the array A.
Output:
Print the minimum time(seconds) in which all array elements will become greater than or equal to K.
